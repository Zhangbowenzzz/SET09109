\paragraph{What happens?}

The application deadlocks and no data is printed.

\paragraph{Why does this happen?}

This happens because GSPairsA first writes to \mintinline{groovy}{outChannel0} which is read by GPlus.  After this GSPairsA writes to \mintinline{groovy}{outChannel1}, this value is read by GTail which discards the value.  GSPairsA then attempts to write to \mintinline{groovy}{outChannel0} however, because nothing has been written to GPlus's second input channel, the code locks at this write call.  To continue execution GSPairs must write to \mintinline{groovy}{outChanel1} however it is unable to do this as the two write calls are in series not parallel.
